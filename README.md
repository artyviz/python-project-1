# Cloud-Connected Rover Car with Serverless Technology

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a cloud-connected rover car leveraging serverless technology. The rover car is based on SBrio hardware interfaces with LAN, extending connectivity to serverless cloud platforms. The integration of AWS services enhances military-grade security and provides a robust infrastructure for automated operations.

## Key Features

- **Hardware Interface**: Utilizes SBrio-based hardware interfaces for seamless integration with LAN networks.
- **Serverless Cloud Connectivity**: Leveraging serverless technology for cloud connectivity, reducing operational overhead and ensuring scalability.
- **AWS Integration**: Integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for enhanced security, reliability, and scalability.
- **Automated Operations**: Enables automated operations for the rover car, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implements military-grade security measures to safeguard sensitive data and operations.

## Components

### Hardware Components
- SBrio-based rover car
- LAN connectivity

### Software Components
- Python code for rover car operations
- AWS IoT Core for cloud connectivity
- AWS Lambda for serverless computing
- AWS IAM for security management

## Usage

1. Ensure the rover car hardware is properly configured and connected to the LAN network.
2. Set up AWS IoT Core with appropriate configurations, including Thing creation and certificate management.
3. Deploy the provided Python code to the rover car hardware.
4. Configure AWS Lambda functions to handle rover car commands and automate operations.
5. Monitor and manage rover car operations through the AWS Management Console.

## Security Considerations

- Implement strict access controls and IAM policies to restrict access to sensitive resources.
- Encrypt data transmission between the rover car and AWS IoT Core using TLS.
- Regularly update firmware and software components to address security vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

This project is a prototype and may require further refinement and testing before deployment in production environments. Use caution when operating the rover car in real-world scenarios, especially in sensitive or hazardous environments.
