The software within this prototype is intricately designed to facilitate cloud connectivity. Leveraging serverless technology, it enables the activation of functions, thus automating the car's operations. The comprehensive backend not only furnishes a database but also provides detailed user-requested information. This encompasses graphical representations of travel distances, real-time location tracking, collision detection, and an automated emergency response system that contacts nearby hospitals in case of accidents. Furthermore, it possesses object detection capabilities, automatically altering the car's trajectory. Additionally, an interactive control system empowers users to oversee and simulate the vehicle's functions.

The hardware component, featuring the SBrio robot, serves as the prototype's foundation. It interfaces with a LAN network, extendable to the serverless cloud. By utilizing this infrastructure, the Wi-Fi-enabled rover car achieves automation, enabling it to navigate, detect obstacles, and adjust its path accordingly. Moreover, the implementation of ESP32 contributes a 360-degree surveillance capability. This prototype aims to demonstrate how such software innovations can bolster military security and automation. It promises to streamline transportation and surveillance processes within the military domain. Importantly, all data is integrated into the AWS server cloud and securely stored within the database.

Future enhancements are planned, focusing on backend improvements and optimizations. There's a concerted effort to develop a comprehensive web application that consolidates all functionalities for user convenience. The plan includes creating dedicated Android and iOS applications, ensuring remote accessibility for users. Technological advancements will replace LAN connectivity with USB-C, enhancing efficiency. Finally, a server-based backup system will complement the serverless technology for added safety and data redundancy.
